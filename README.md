Andrew Li - Github Page

The Github page was properly updated to contain the information required for the assignment.  Three pages were created: index, resume, and bio.  These pages each use a different stylesheet.  Styling and HTML was kept separate by keeping all code relating to styling in the .css files.  The pages also all pass the w3 validator, and the css validator.  All necessary information was included as well in the resume.  

The project was completed independently.
