Lab 4 - Andrew Li

Any machine with a width greater than 700px will display the message 
'Dice'.  Any device with width smaller than 700px will display the 
message 'No dice'.  

i.e.:
On a standard computer screen = Dice
On a mobile device (iPhone/Android) = No dice

Mobile device I tested with was a Motorola Droid Razr (540x960px).
